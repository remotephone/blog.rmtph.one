I found Jekyll to be pretty well documented, but some I'm somewhat impatient with documentation. [This](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) site was the first guide I followed, but you take their layout and then I was unable to make themes happen cleanly. From what I can tell, the _layouts and other custom bits override any theme you want to apply. 

I'm pretty comfortable on the command line, so next I tired Github's documentation [here.](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/)
