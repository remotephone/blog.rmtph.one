I don't know markdown syntax but it seems easy enough. This page is intended to be a quick reference for the 5-10 things I will no doubt do over and over and over.

[This page](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) seems pretty interesting, it has a lot of the syntax I'll be using.

This is the format for my post titles. Markup will usually be md for markdown, but maybe I'll get fancy one day.


``` YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP ```


To create a link, use ``` \[Text\]\(http\(s\)://site\.com\) ```

You can add a excerpt_separator: line to your _config.yml file to set a preview in your post. I haven't gotten it to work yet...
