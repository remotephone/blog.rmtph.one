Docker is pretty nifty. I won't pretend I'm getting the most possible out of it, but the learning curve required to get a whole lot of functionality out of it is really shallow. I have Docker installed in a VM. Like I described earlier, I got it working well enough and then snapshotted it. If you're not paying attention to what you're doing, you can run into a lot of errors and annoyances you don't see coming.
