## Why not just attack someone else?

Because it's illegal. 

### Attacking a home lab

If you're doing this on a budget, you have a few ways to go about this. You can either use old machines you have laying around to install OSes and applications on and attack those systems or you can do something virtualized. Since I'm doing this on a budget and don't want to reinstall OSes all day, I'm doing this virtualized. I'll be doing this in docker again because why not, but you could just as easily do something in a VM and snapshot it before you really attack. I also am very interested in how docker and containers complicate breaking into systems, so this is as good of a time as any to figure it out.


For this lab, I'm using a docker container of LAMP and a local installation of Damn Vulnerable Web Applications. Let's first get our docker container.
