## So you want a lab?

It's going to cost money. You can't do this for free. Luckily, you've probably spent most of it already. I do everything I need to do on my desktop which does triple duty as a workstation and gaming machine. You don't need as much storage as I have, but it comes in handy.  



Here's my desktop configuration:

* AMD FX-6350 - overclocked and Hyper212 Evo knockoff Cooler
* 16GB of ram
* 2 SSD's - 120GB for Windows Install & 256 GB drive split 30GB for Linux install and 220GB for VM drives
* 2TB internal storage drive - Windows image backups, media, other stuff
* 750 GB drive - 500GB for games, 250 GB for random backups
* AMD RX-480 8GB
* External 2TB drive for backing up everything important

The logic here is I have enough cores to run multiple VMs at once and enough storage to keep them all. Other processors are better and I'd upgrade if I needed to, but my processor does pretty well overclocked, I think I'm at 4.5ghz.
