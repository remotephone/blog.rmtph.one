Hi, I'm Jaime. I work in security and enjoy pentesting, incident response, and testing new technologies. I spend an enormous amount of time googling and documenting things, and this is my attempt to reduce that time. 

### Other interests and info

I do plenty of things, most of which have nothing to do with the content of this blog. I hope to one day to have produced some original content here and reproduced some other's content I've had to modify or update to make work. 

### Contact me

Not yet, maybe when there's something on here worth discussing.
