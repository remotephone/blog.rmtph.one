Hi, I'm Jaime. I work in security and enjoy defensive security, incident response, offsensive security, and testing new technologies. I spend an enormous amount of time googling and documenting things, and this is my attempt to reduce that time. You'll find articles that aren't complete because I'm working on them. I hope to get back to everything eventually, but at least until I have a good base of posts, I'll finish what I start before I start something else.  

### Other interests and info

I do plenty of things, most of which have nothing to do with the content of this blog. I hope to one day to have produced some original content here and reproduced some other's content I've had to modify or update to make work.
