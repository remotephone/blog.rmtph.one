    <p>Hi, I’m Jaime. I work in security and enjoy pentesting, incident response, and testing new technologies. I spend an enormous amount of time googling and documenting things, and this is my attempt to reduce that time.</p>

<h3 id="other-interests-and-info">Other interests and info</h3>

<p>I do plenty of things, most of which have nothing to do with the content of this blog. I hope to one day to have produced some original content here and reproduced some other’s content I’ve had to modify or update to make work.</p>

<h3 id="many-thanks-to">Many thanks to</h3>
